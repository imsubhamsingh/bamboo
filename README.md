python bambo/cli.py -f urls.txt
```

### Setting Custom Headers

Include custom headers with each request:
```bash
python bambo/cli.py -u "https://example.com" --headers "Authorization:Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" "Content-Type:application/json"
```

### Using Different HTTP Methods and Data Payload

Use different HTTP methods and send data:
```bash
python bambo/cli.py -u "https://api.example.com/data" -m POST --data '{"key":"value"}'
